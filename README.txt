UPDATE 24/04/2014
- Numerous updates to module to introduce new activities + fix old broken ones.
- Update to report functionality and grading:
  - Grading interface modified to be more helpful.
  - For graded exercises, they should be graded much more accurately over the number of marks given per exercise rather than number of questions in total. The gradebook summary has also been updated and fixed to be more accurate.
  - Numerous exercise content summaries now reflect this.
Below is a list of activites that have been tested and should have full functionality (including grading) working correctly:
- Hangman
- Scrambled Sentences
- Word Guessing
- Scrambled Paragraphs
- Split Sentences
- Collocation Matching
- Collocation Dominoes
- Related Words
- Collocation Guessing
Any activities not included on this list may not work correctly. They will one day be investigated further.
